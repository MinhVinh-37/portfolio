          <h2>About myself</h2>
          <p>
            Hi everyone, I was born on May 2nd, 2000. I was born in Binh Thuan
            province. My house is only 200m from the sea, however I cannot swim.
            Currently I'm living and working at Ho Chi Minh city.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was a kid, I very fond of logical and electronics things. I
            used to good at Math and Physics. Therefore, I become a software
            engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the college, I was a researcher at the IC Design Lab at HCMUT in
            AI technology. At that time, I spent all my time reading scientific
            paper and learning about <b>Machine Learning</b> and
            <b>Deep Learning</b>, it was a very hard time. However the results
            is sastified, I <b>published a scientific paper</b> at a scientific
            conference about a CNN model. After that, I work as a Backend End
            Engineer at MoneyForward Viet Nam, which is a
            <b>Japan product company</b>. I involved in two projects:
            <b>managing electrical invoices</b> and
            <b>sending electrical invoices</b>, which
            <b
              >scalabily, reliability, high performance, easy monitoring and
              fault tolerance</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I'm usually playing video games, watching Kdrama,
            watching anime, playing soccer, playing soccer and hanging out with
            my friends or colleges.
