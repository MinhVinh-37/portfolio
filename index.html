          <h2>About myself</h2>
          <p>
            Hi everyone, I was born on May 2nd, 2000. I was born in Binh Thuan
            province. My house is only 200m from the sea, however I cannot swim.
            Currently, I'm living and working in Ho Chi Minh City.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was a kid, I was very fond of logical and electronic things.
            I used to be good at Math and Physics. Therefore, I become a
            software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In college, I was a researcher at the IC Design Lab at HCMUT in AI
            technology. At that time, I spent all my time reading scientific
            papers and learning about <b>Machine Learning</b> and
            <b>Deep Learning</b>, it was a very hard time. However the result is
            satisfactory, that is I <b>published a scientific paper</b> at a
            scientific conference about a CNN model. After that,After that, I
            worked as a Backend End Engineer at MoneyForward Viet Nam, which is
            a <b>Japanese product company</b>. I am currently involved in two
            projects: <b>managing electrical invoices</b> and
            <b>sending electrical invoices</b>, which are
            <b
              >scalability, reliability, high performance, easy monitoring, and
              fault tolerance.</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I usually play video games, watch Kdrama, watch
            anime, play soccer, and hang out with my friends or colleagues.
